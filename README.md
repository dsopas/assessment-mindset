# Security Assessment Mindset

![Cool image from Char49](https://0xhack.com/mindset_david.png)

## Why
I did this to help me on my security assessments (pentest, bug bounty, red-team, kung) and to keep my work well organized.

Each time I finished a task, I marked it with a check icon using [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/). If you don't have this tool, print the image version and use your pencil to mark it as done.

Included in this mindset is [WAHH Methodology](http://mdsec.net/wahh/tasks.html), [API Security Checklist](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist) and [IOT PenTesting Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/adi0x901/iot-pentesting-guide/details) from [@adi1391](https://twitter.com/adi1391).

On some particular tasks you have notes (only in XMind format) that provide the name of some tools or links you might use for that particular task.

## Formats
If you don't have XMind software, I exported the PNG, Freemind and OPML versions. If you need other format, please let me know so I can start exporting it in future versions.

## How to contribute
