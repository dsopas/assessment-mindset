# Security Assessment Mindset

![Cool image from Char49](https://char49.com/labs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mindset.jpg)

## Why
I did this to help me on my security assessments (pentest, bug bounty, red-team, kung foo, you name it) and to keep my work well organized.

Each time I finished a task, I marked it with a check icon using [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/). If you don't have this tool, print the image version and use your pencil to mark it as done.

Included in this mindset is [WAHH Methodology](http://mdsec.net/wahh/tasks.html), [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/) and [IOT PenTesting Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/adi0x901/iot-pentesting-guide/details) from [@adi1391](https://twitter.com/adi1391).

## Formats
If you don't have XMind software, I exported the PNG versions and OPML. 
If you need other format, please let me know so I can start exporting it in future versions.

## How to contribute
New tasks, tools, typos and other things you think it would help this mindmap, please **Create a Pull request on dev branch** with the OPML version. 
Remember that this is open to ALL infosec community so let us all keep things rolling  :thumbsup:. Any question, feel free to ping me at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dsopas).
